The importance of testing in modern software development is really hard to overstate. Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about, but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software has to remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.

Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and ultimately leading to high-level architectures such as the "Clean Architecture" and similar.

Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it's hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it's hard to argue that it's not a good thing.

However, despite there being many different approaches, modern "best practices" primarily push developers specifically towards *unit testing*. Tests, whose scope lies higher on [Martin Fowler's pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid) are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.

The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they're able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term "unit testing" is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.

When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these "best practices" to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn't particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.

It was only later, as I've experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that **focusing on unit tests is**, in most cases, **a complete waste of time**.

Aggressively-popularized "best practices" often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry's unhealthy obsession with unit testing.

In this article I will share my observations about unit testing and explain why I believe it to be a waste of time. I'll also explain which approaches I'm currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.

## Fallacy of unit testing

Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a "unit", which denotes a very small, logically-independent part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it's mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a program (or a method of a class).

By executing the function with different inputs and comparing produced results to expected outputs, we can ensure that the function works correctly. If we test all units in a system in the same fashion, we can probably ensure that the system as a whole works correctly as well. Of course, that only works if the units are integrated with each other in a decoupled way which would allows us to isolate them easily, hence the need for dependency inversion.

While testing in such way, we are supposedly able to:

- Find problems quickly and early.
- Detect regressions and have confidence in refactoring.
- Enforce good design principles in our code.
- Have a living documentation of the system.

In reality, things are a bit different. Let's take a look at each of these points separately.

## Summary

Whenever you say "testing" in a room full of software developers, it is immediately assumed that you're talking about unit testing. I believe it's really unfortunate the industry arrived at this stereotype.

I think unit testing is inefficient and most of the time not worth doing at all. You're almost always better of writing wider-scope tests that cover a larger set of interactions, such as functional tests. Functional tests should match specifications that describe how the user can interact with the system and what they can observe in the process.

Unit testing should be prioritized lower, ultimately considering it only as last resort. Instead of spending time trying to make your code more "unit-testable", it's more beneficial to make it more "functionally-testable" instead.

The topic of testing is very popular and there quite a lot of articles written that challenge the necessity for ubiquitous unit tests. I don't necessarily agree with everything mentioned in them, but they are well-reasoned and at the very least provide some food for thought:
