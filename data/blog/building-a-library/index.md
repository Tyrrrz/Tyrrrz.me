Developing a library involves a lot of moving pieces, and not all of them are just about writing code. In a modern software development environment, we also need to think about the infrastructure behind our code, how we build, test, and distribute our library, and most importantly, how we can optimize and automate these processes to make them as efficient as possible.

Setting up such processes is not a very difficult task in itself, but with the vast array of different options available and the various strategies to consider, it can be easy to get lost in the details. And while there is no one-size-fits-all solution, there are still a few common approaches that can be applied to most .NET library projects out there.

In this article we're going to explore the current state of the art when it comes to building a library in .NET â€” starting from configuring your project settings, setting up a working CI/CD pipeline, and finally publishing the library to NuGet. I will show some of the most common approaches, highlighting their trade-offs, and share my personal recommendations, leaning on my 8-year experience of building and maintaining several widely used libraries in .NET. Hopefully, this will give you a decent starting point if you're planning to build your own library and help avoid some of the common pitfalls along the way.
