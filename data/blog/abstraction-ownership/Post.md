Abstraction, as a concept, is a fundamental part of software design. Solving complex problems often requires an incremental approach that involves decomposing them into simpler, more manageable pieces, which can be reasoned about and dealt with separately. In doing so, we naturally go through the process of identifying key aspects of each of those problems, isolating them away from less consequential details, and, ultimately, abstracting them into generalized models.

Abstractions can be compared based on many aspects, including their fitness to solve a problem, their complexity, and their ability to be reused. These are concepts that are familiar to us, as programmers.

A well-crafted abstraction

One aspect that is not considered nearly as much is the concept of abstraction ownership. Who owns the abstraction, whether it's the provider or the consumer, carries a significant weight in its usefulness, as well as shapes the design of programming languages that employ them.
