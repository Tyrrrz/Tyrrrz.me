In software, solving complex problems typically requires us to decompose them into simpler, more manageable parts that can be reasoned about separately. By doing so, we go through the process of identifying key aspects pertaining to each of those parts, isolating them away from less consequential details, and, ultimately, generalizing them into abstract models.

Carefully designed abstractions can help better understand the problem domain and eliminate unnecessary complexity, while also facilitating code reuse and extensibility. Conversely, poor abstractions may suffer from unclear boundaries, lead to confusion and overcomplication, and become generally inconvenient to work with.

When evaluating abstractions in software design, we are used to consider factors such as their mental overhead, conceptual fitness, or 

One aspect that is not considered nearly as much is the concept of abstraction ownership. Who owns the abstraction, whether it's the provider or the consumer, carries a significant weight in its usefulness, as well as shapes the design of programming languages that employ them.

## Abstraction ownership

## Nominal typing

## Structural typing

TypeScript's structural nature has circumstantial origin, having inherited it from JavaScript. But, there are also other languages that primarily use structural typing, such as Go interfaces

## Mixing language paradigms

## Designing with ownership in mind
